# README
- Place the [ FileOrganiser.py ] into the folder you wish to organise and then run the program.

- If folders of the same name are found, then files will be placed in those folders - otherwise, new folders will be created.

- Files already in folders with the same name as the file in the root directory attempting to be moved will take priority / will not be overwritten.
	Option can be added later to switch overwriting on/off, or make it so duplicate files will be named differently to keep both files.
